# Hyperpolymath Estate — ecosystem-scoped lint + format check (pre-commit)
# Source: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards
#
# CONFINEMENT IS THE POINT. Each check runs only when THIS repo has staged
# files of that kind. A Rust check must not fire in a ReScript repo, and a V
# toolchain must never be summoned to lint a Coq development.
#
# READ-ONLY. Every command here reports; none rewrites a tracked file.
# `cargo fmt --check`, `nickel format --check`, `v fmt -verify`. The
# bare/`-w`/`--fix` forms are banned in this file.
#
# TWO FAILURE POLICIES, and the difference is deliberate:
#
#   * TOOLCHAIN MISSING, ecosystem toolchain (cargo, nickel, v, bun) →
#     FAIL CLOSED. You cannot have authored a .rs without cargo, so "cargo not
#     found" means a broken environment, not an exempt one. Skipping there
#     would report success having examined nothing.
#
#   * DENO is neither: it is BANNED, so no Deno toolchain is ever summoned.
#     Its section refuses rather than checks — see it below.
#
#   * OPTIONAL LINTER MISSING (hlint, fourmolu) → reported as an explicit
#     SKIP line, not as a pass, and CI remains the authority. These are add-ons
#     rather than the toolchain, so their absence is an ordinary state of a
#     working machine and must not block every commit on every machine.
#
# Override for one commit: git commit --no-verify
# Skip the slow Rust clippy pass: ESTATE_HOOK_SKIP_SLOW=1 (prints a loud
# warning — the gate did NOT run, and that is not the same as passing).

# over staged JS in a tree that tracked a deno.json, behind a `warn`. That
# lint-checked — and thereby blessed — the very thing the warning called
# banned, and it summoned a banned toolchain to do it.
#
# It now refuses. The question it asks is deliberately NARROWER than CI's:
#
#   * CI asks "does this repository still carry Deno debt?", and answers it
#     against the central shrink-only ledger
#     `.machine_readable/deno-allow.txt` in `standards`.
#   * This hook CANNOT ask that — it runs inside a caller's checkout and has
#     no access to that ledger — and must not fake an answer. It asks instead
#     "is THIS COMMIT ADDING Deno debt?", which is answerable right here.
#
# STAGED is `--diff-filter=ACM`, so a DELETED deno.json never appears: paying
# the debt down is never blocked, only growing it. That is the same
# shrink-only direction the central ledger enforces, reached without one.
