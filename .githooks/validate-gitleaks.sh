# Hyperpolymath Estate — staged-secret scan (pre-commit)
# Source: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards
#
# Scans ONLY what is staged, so it runs in the time a commit can afford.
#
# FAILS CLOSED. If gitleaks is not installed this exits non-zero and prints the
# install line. It never returns 0 on "could not scan": "validator absent" and
# "no secrets found" produce exactly the same silence, and a gate that reports
# success having examined nothing is worse than no gate at all — it is a gate
# somebody trusts.
#
# --redact is NOT optional. --verbose without it prints the discovered secret
# to the terminal and into scrollback, CI logs and any `script`/tmux capture,
# which turns a near-miss into a second disclosure.
